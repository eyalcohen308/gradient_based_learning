# gradient_based_learning
As part of Deep Learning for Text and Sequences course I implemented a log-linear classifier and a multi-layer
perceptron classifier.I also write the training code for them.
All the classifiers uses the hard cross-entropy loss.
I tested the classifiers on the language identification task, and the XOR task.

1. XOR task - given a 2D input vector, return the vector's xor.
2. language identification task - given a text written in some language, return in what language the text is written
